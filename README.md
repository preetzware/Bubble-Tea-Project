## Design

### Color Scheme
The color scheme for this website was greatly inspired by an existing store's logo. It is made up of a triadic color scheme that not only creates a classy and dynamic effect but also a good contrast throughout. By uploading the logo on the Canva palette generator,  the following color combinations were created in hex value:

### Typography

Three fonts imported from Google fonts were largely used throughout this website, namely 'Barriecito' for the hero image text overlay, 'Charm'(Bold 700) for the headings and 'Inter'(Regular 400) for the rest parts. Fallback fonts such as Sans-serif, Cursive and System-sui were also added as suggested by Google fonts on the 'How to use' section.

## Imagery
Pinterest was mainly used to search, save and organize the images in a board to be used for the project, with exception to some images bearing the 'Bobo tea' logo which were downloaded from the Instagram page of the Bobo tea shop with the permission of the owner. The quality of the images were tested on (https://fineartprinting.com.sg/image-analyser/#)

## Wireframes
The first and foremost wireframes for this website were made on paper and thereafter modified slightly when it was created digitally using Balsamiq.com. The website consists of five pages in total - the Home page, Menu page, Gallery page, Sign Up page and a Thank You page where subscribers are redirected to upon signing-up. 

## Features

- Navigation Bar
The navigation bar for this website is featured on each page, with the business logo positioned on the left side and all the other navigational links situated to the right side. This style is set for devices with max screen size 950px and 1200px and this is how it looks:

For small screen sizes such as screen size max 768px and max 594px and down, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on the right corner while the logo hangs still on the left side. Upon clicking on the hamburger menu, it will drop down to feature the rest pages which are highlighted into a box shadow upon hovering.

### Future Implemenations
At some point in the future, I would like to add an order button in the navbar and 
link it to a page which will be designed accordingly for online delivery orders or click and collect orders which will be beneficial to the business will also meet the users purpose.

Generally, aria labels have been placed in all the pages as well as alt text on images to make it more accessible for users with low vision, users with mobility disabilities and users with memory loss.

## Testing

## Manual Testing
W3C Validator was used to validate the HTML 5 code written on all pages for my website



## Lighthouse Testing
Google Chrome's Lighthouse Developer Tool was utilized for gauging the performance and accessibility measures of the website. Initially, the performance and speed was slowed down greatly by large images even though they had been compressed, sometimes twice, using TinyPNG.com. I had then converted these images from jpeg format to webp, which significantly improved the performance of my website. Below are the final Lighthouse results.
